### Code Description:
I built a simple user management system using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB to handle student records efficiently. My API allows users to save, update, delete, and retrieve student data from the database. I used Express.js to manage HTTP requests and Mongoose to define schemas and interact with MongoDB in a structured way. Some key routes include **POST /save-student** for adding new records, **POST /update** for modifying student details, and **GET /user** to fetch student data based on their ID. I also integrated Needle for testing API requests to ensure everything works as expected. 

### How to use:
(1) Set up the required dependencies. </br>
(2) Start the MongoDB service. </br>
(3) Run the server. </br>
(4) Test the API using Needle.
